# ML Ops Project

This project implements Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) for developing and deploying a regression model using MLflow.

## Overview

Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) is a set of practices and tools used to streamline the process of deploying, managing, and monitoring machine learning models in production environments. This project serves as a practical example of implementing MLOps principles to develop and deploy a regression model using MLflow.

The project follows a structured approach, covering key steps such as data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment. MLflow, an open-source platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle, is used for experiment tracking, model management, and deployment.

## Setup Instructions

Setting up the project environment is straightforward, requiring only a few steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Begin by cloning the repository to your local machine using Git.

2. **Install Dependencies**: Install the necessary Python packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file using pip.

3. **Run MLflow Tracking Server**: Launch the MLflow tracking server to monitor experiment runs, metrics, and artifacts.

4. **Connect to MLflow UI**: Access the MLflow tracking UI through your web browser to visualize experiment results and manage models.

## Usage

The project provides a clear workflow for using MLflow to develop and deploy a regression model:

1. **Data Preparation**: Ensure your dataset is in CSV format and contains the required columns for training the regression model. Adjust the data path in the code if necessary.

2. **Train the Model**: Execute the `train_model.py` script to train the regression model using the specified algorithm and hyperparameters.

3. **View Experiments in MLflow UI**: Explore the MLflow UI to inspect experiment runs, track performance metrics, and visualize model artifacts.

4. **Deploy the Model**: Utilize MLflow's deployment capabilities to serve the trained model as a REST API endpoint, enabling real-time predictions.

5. **Make Predictions**: Send HTTP requests to the deployed model endpoint with input data to obtain predictions.

## Troubleshooting Tips

If you encounter any issues during setup or usage of the project, consider the following troubleshooting tips:

- Check for correct installation of dependencies and ensure compatibility with your Python environment.
- Verify that data paths are correctly specified and accessible.
- Monitor console output and log messages for errors or warnings, and address them accordingly.
- Consult the MLflow documentation and community forums for additional support and guidance.
