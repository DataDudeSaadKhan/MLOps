# ML Ops Project

This project implements Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) for developing and deploying a regression model using MLflow.

## Overview

This project aims to demonstrate the end-to-end process of developing and deploying a regression model using MLflow. It includes steps for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment. MLflow is used for experiment tracking, model management, and deployment.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone <https://github.com/DataDudeSaadKhan/MLOps>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: 
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run MLflow Tracking Server**: 
   ```bash
   mlflow ui
   ```

4. **Connect to MLflow UI**: 
   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to access the MLflow tracking UI.

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Ensure your dataset is in CSV format and contains the necessary columns.
   - Replace `'/content/winequality_red.csv'` in the code with the path to your dataset.

2. **Train the Model**:
   - Run the `train_model.py` script to train the regression model.
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

3. **View Experiments in MLflow UI**:
   - Navigate to the MLflow UI to view experiment runs, metrics, parameters, and artifacts.

4. **Deploy the Model**:
   - Use the MLflow deployment commands to deploy the trained model.
   ```bash
   mlflow models serve -m runs:/<run_id>/model -p 5001
   ```

5. **Make Predictions**:
   - Send HTTP requests to the deployed model endpoint (`http://localhost:5001/predict`) with input data to make predictions.

## Troubleshooting Tips

- If you encounter any issues with package installations, ensure that you have the correct versions of Python and pip installed.
- Check for typos or syntax errors in the code and correct them accordingly.
- If MLflow UI does not launch, verify that the correct port (default: 5000) is not already in use.
- Refer to the MLflow documentation for troubleshooting specific MLflow-related issues.
